# libuv-ssl
Add SSL/TLS functionality on top of libuv

This small library adds SSL/TLS functionality using BIO pair on libuv and is currently work in progress.
The TLS work is complete for server but TLS client interface and DTLS support need to be worked on.

TODO:
- include licensing terms which will be MIT
- Improve error handling - may be introducing our own enum
- Add renegotiation feature
